## 🏗️ Build as EXE
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name "Cropper4096" crop_gui.py
```

After building:
```
dist/
└── Cropper4096.exe
```

> Typical file size: 50–100 MB (includes Python and Tk/Tcl runtime).

## 🔏 Optional: Local code-signing (Windows)

To reduce SmartScreen or antivirus warnings on **your PC**,  
you can locally sign the `.exe` with a self-signed certificate using the provided PowerShell script:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "sign\sign.ps1"
```

This script:
- Creates a self-signed “Cropper4096 Developer” certificate  
- Adds it to your user’s trusted stores  
- Signs all `.exe` files inside the `dist` folder  

Check the signature:
```powershell
Get-AuthenticodeSignature ".\dist\Cropper4096.exe" | fl Status,StatusMessage
```
You should see `Status : Valid`.

> On other computers, the certificate must be installed into *Trusted Publisher* and *Root* stores  
> or replaced with a paid code-signing certificate (e.g., Comodo, Sectigo, DigiCert).
